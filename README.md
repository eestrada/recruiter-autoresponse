# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Thanks for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about new and exciting opportunities. As a software engineer I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out to me. It is a wonderful position to be in and I'm thankful for it.

It also means that I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit.

Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to? 

It is critical to note that I currently have no intentions of taking anything other than remote work. If the position requires relocation, I am not interested in continuing the conversation; candidates other than myself will be a better fit.

While I appreciate that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.

In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.
Thanks again for reaching out!

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ethan
