# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

## the autoresponse

```
Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to? A lot of the time, incoming recruiter messages represent a poor fit, and I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out.

It is also critical to note that I currently have no intentions of taking anything other than remote work. If the position requires relocation or regularly being onsite, I am not interested in continuing the conversation; candidates other than myself will be a better fit.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.

Ethan
